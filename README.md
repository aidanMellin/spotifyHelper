Hey! So this project was something that I have been doing in my spare time the past couple of days.

Essentially (in its current bare-bones state), it has the ability to add specific tracks, albums, and the top ten songs of an artist
to a user designated playlist, using a config file and the commands 
  --t (track)
  --art (artist)
  --alb (album)
  |--plist (playlist)| has yet to be implemented
 
From here, I plan to expand by 
  automating the request for an authorization token,
  finish implementing the playlist search function
  Add the usage for pulling a users top artists, songs, and albums
  and finally implementing a GUI that makes it look pretty :)
